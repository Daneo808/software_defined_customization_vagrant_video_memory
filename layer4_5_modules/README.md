# Layer 4.5 Customization Modules

We have developed several Layer 4.5 customization modules to help illustrate possible customizations and to perform experimentation.  The breakdown of this folder is as follows:

    * sample_modules: Beginner modules to help illustrate how Layer 4.5 works.  Includes steps to perform Layer 4.5 customization using an echo client and server.  These modules include more comments that other modules will have.

    * netsoft: Modules developed specifically for testing the overhead of Layer 4.5 and included in the NetSoft '22 submission.  Modules include inserting tags into DNS and HTTP connections.

    * geni: Modules developed for the GENI networking environment.  These modules are used for testing Layer 4.5 over the open internet and for testing the NCO functionality to deploy modules to various networks on a rotating basis.


    * extra: Modules used for testing Layer 4.5 functionality, but are not fully developed.
