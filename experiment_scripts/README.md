# Layer 4.5 Experiment Scripts

We have developed several Layer 4.5 experiment scripts to test and experiment with the modules in the layer4\_5\_modules folder.  The breakdown of this folder is as follows:

* client\_server: supplies a basic python echo client/server, python simple server, and TLS simple server.

* feature\_test: various tests for new features, such as activating, deprecating, etc.

* netsoft: Experiments developed specifically for testing the overhead of Layer 4.5 and included in the NetSoft '22 paper.  

* geni: Experiments developed for the GENI networking environment.  These experiments are used for testing Layer 4.5 over the open internet and for testing the NCO functionality to deploy modules to various networks on a rotating basis.

* logs: holds experiment logs for review
